Plant Closure Decision Using the Factor-Rating System
After the merger, the decision to shut down one plant should be based on a structured evaluation of key factors influencing operations. The Factor-Rating system is an effective method to assess multiple criteria and make an objective decision.
Weighted Scores
The given ratings are multiplied by the respective factor weights to obtain weighted scores:
Factor	Weight	Europe (EU)	N. America	S. America	Rest of Asia
Cost	0.40	2.80	3.20	2.40	3.60
Market Proximity	0.20	1.20	1.40	1.00	1.60
Infrastructure	0.15	1.20	1.05	0.90	0.90
Labor Cost	0.15	0.75	0.90	1.05	1.05
Tax/Duty Benefits	0.10	0.70	0.60	0.80	0.70
Total Score		6.65	7.15	6.15	7.85
Results
•	The plant in Rest of Asia has the highest total score (7.85), meaning it is the best location to keep.
•	North America follows closely with a score of 7.15.
•	South America has the lowest total score (6.15), suggesting it is the least favorable location.
Decision & Justification
Based on the Factor-Rating analysis, the South American plant should be shut down due to the following reasons:
1.	Weak market proximity: The South American plant has the lowest market proximity score (5.00), reducing its competitiveness in terms of demand.
2.	Overall lowest score: The combined weighted factor score (6.15) is the lowest among all regions.
Conclusion
Shutting down the South American plant is the most strategic decision as it ranks the lowest in a structured evaluation of cost, market access, infrastructure, labor cost, and tax benefits.
